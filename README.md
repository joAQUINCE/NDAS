# Nuclear Design Analysis Software (NDAS)

## About NDAS

NDAS is a full-stack software application developed to streamline the generation of calculations and other engineering documentation across the nuclear industry.

NDAS processes common design information and distributes it to clients (i.e.: thermal-hydraulic design, piping design, pipe support design, drafting, plant simulator, etc.). The system also supports administrative tasks such as the generation of calculation templates, stress contour drawings, piping isometrics and hydraulic reports.

## Access

The NDAS code base is not accessible through public repositories.
